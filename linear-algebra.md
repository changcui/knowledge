# Linear algebra

### MIT Lesson 1

The key of linear algebra is to solve the equation Ax=b. We can view the equation from three perspectives.

- Matrix. Ax = b, it's a systemic way to tackle the problem.
- Row picture. just like 2x + y = 1, -x + 3y = 2, it seems to find a point solving the above equations both, but it is hard to find a solution and also difficult to visualize when the dimension is large.
- Col picture. it's a good idea to regard Ax=b as a combination with the cols of matrix A. So when a matrix left-times a vector x, it means to combine the cols of A using the elements of x. As a result, the cols and rows of a matrix seem to be unequal, have different meaning at less.

When A is inverted, non-singular, it means the cols of A can fill the whole space, in other words, each col contributes something new, independent with the other cols.

So the key idea is to find out the properties of the matrix A, when the space can be filled, when can not, shall we find a normal solution or a metric to tackle the problem.
